The user has the capablity to input employee name, role, and department information into this tracker. They may also create new department and roles as they desire. Upon adding new department and roles, when adding another employee, those roles and departments will appear as choices to apply to the employee along with existing roles and departments. The user may also update employee's role should that employee change roles.
